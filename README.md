# strong-workout-app-statistics



## Overview
I only built this because the built in statistics for the [app](https://www.strong.app/) are expensive and broken.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Clone the repo

## Usage
1. **Data Extraction**: In the strong app go to export your data
2. **Setup data**: Put the exported csv file into `strong-workout-app-statistics/data`
3. **Setup** cd into strong-workout-app-statistics
4. **Install libraries**: run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. **Run and use**: Modify the values inside `src/main.py` in `plot_exercise` and run the script with: `py src/main.py`
